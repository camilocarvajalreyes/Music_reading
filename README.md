### Data set used: MUSCIMA++ dataset v0.9

### Abstract:

A musician's mission consists of transforming images of musical sheets into sounds. This can be done by extracting the meaning of each musical item depending on its position and shape. 
Thus, the purpose behind this work is to explore a first approach of a system capable of transforming images of music sheets into actual sounds, which corresponds to an image recognition problem. The translation of musical sheets only requires the recognition of each item as well as its position. Our work addresses the first problem, which is the hardest one, specially when it comes to handwritten musical scores.  Several algorithms were tested, including a non supervised one, achieving a high degree of accuracy.

Supervised and unsupervised approaches can be found on the two notebooks avalaible in this repository. The data set is also included. Warning: this version is not the latest one!
